            <h2>spring again</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>spring came /
            the same way winter left
            & summer will come
            & summer will leave;        slowly
                      / when no one's expecting it
                         when people are tired of waiting
            
            like waiting for welfare checks /
                      a long wait/             a slow wait
            
            the windows are open
            but butterflies don't fly in
            to display a sense of love
            
                       / only housefly enter
                          to sit on food       & eat crumbs
            
            & dreams escape /
            & become stolen      & lost      & used
            & wasted        & thrown away
            & dreamed anew
            
            the junkies sit on the stoop
            & nod themselves into dreams
                        / maybe into the ones which escaped
            & stickball is played
            & on warm nights        the ghetto musicians play
            our ghetto song
            on garbage can tops         & bang on empty coke bottles
            & sound real ch√©vere
            
            :tomorrow
            the junkies will sit on the stoop
            & nod themselves into dreams /
            stickball will be played /
                                        the streets will become chalked
                                        with 1st and 2nd & 3rd bases
            
            hop scotch will become a game
            & tops will spin on sidewalks /
            
            & everyone will anticipate summer.</pre>
